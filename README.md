Data analysis has a cycle that is frequently used.

- Load the data.
- Structure design with basic preprocessing.
- Various analyses with structured data.
- Conclusions from the results of the analysis

It is also called **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis) because it searches data widely fluttering. EDA is a very basic skill that is a prerequisite for many situations, such as solving problems that can end through simple data analysis without having to go through machine learning and deep learning, preprocessing data before machine learning and deep learning.

This project is based on the subject of "café," which is commonly encountered around us, through the [Small Business market Analysis Data] of the public data portal.

> What percentage of cafes in the country do Starbucks account for?
